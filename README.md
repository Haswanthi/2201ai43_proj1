This project is a collaborative effort between Haswanthi (2201AI43) and Akshitha (2201AI08).This project utilizes a combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL to create a robust web application. PHP serves as the backend scripting language, handling server-side operations and interacting with the MySQL database. HTML and CSS are employed for structuring and styling the frontend user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive experience for users interacting with the application. MySQL is utilized for database management, storing and retrieving data necessary for the functionality of the application. Together, these technologies form the foundation of our project, facilitating its development and functionality.
